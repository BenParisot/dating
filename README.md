## Description

This quiz was created to satisfy the Week 8 Javascript and JQuery Independent Project in Epicodus' Intro to Programming Evening Course. The page uses Javascript and JQuery to take in a text and multiple-choice answers from a visitor and return one of four personalized results using branching if/else statements and slideUp and fadeTo functions. It also includes a button with a location.reload() function to return the user to the start screen.
